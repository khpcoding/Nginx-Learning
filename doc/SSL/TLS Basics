Introduction
TLS stands for Transport Layer Security. It is a protocol that provides privacy and data integrity between two communicating applications. Itâ€™s the most widely deployed security protocol used today replacing Secure Socket Layer (SSL), and is used for web browsers and other applications that require data to be securely exchanged over a network.

TLS ensures that a connection to a remote endpoint is the intended endpoint through encryption and endpoint identity verification. The versions of TLS, to date, are TLS 1.3, 1.2, 1.1, and 1.0.
